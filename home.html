        <h2>History and current terms of interior</h2>

        <p>XTypical interior of one of the houses in the Folk Architecture Reservation in Vlkol√≠nec (Slovakia)
            In the past, interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building.[1]

            The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex
            architecture that has resulted from the development of industrial processes.

            The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the
            development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior design is separate
            and distinct from the role of interior decorator, a term commonly used in the US; the term is less common in
            the UK, where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not
            yet officially a profession.</h2>
